<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is the relay server for CrewLink, an Among Us proximity voice chat program. I am currently hosting a server at `https://crewl.ink/`, but if you want a more reliable option I would suggest to deploy this repository yourself.

## Environment Variables

Optional environment variables:

 - `ADDRESS`: Specifies the server domain
 - `NAME`: Specifies the server name
 - `HTTPS`: Enables https. You must place `privkey.pem` and `fullchain.pem` in your CWD.
 - `SSLPATH`: Specifies an alternate path to SSL certificates.

## Deploy to Heroku

To get up and running quickly, you can deploy to Heroku using the button below

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

This will deploy an instance of the crewlink-server. You can get the URL of your server by using the app name that you gave when you launched the app on heroku and appending `.herokuapp.com`. You can also find the URL of your server by going to "Settings", scrolling down to "Domains". Using this URL, follow step 4 of the [installation instructions](https://github.com/ottomated/CrewLink-server#manual-installation) to connect your client to your server instance.

## Docker Quickstart

Run the server with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) by running the following command:

```
docker run -d -p 9736:9736 ottomated/crewlink-server:latest
```

To change the external port the server uses, change the *first* instance of the port. For example, to use port 8123:

```
docker run -d -p 8123:9736 ottomated/crewlink-server:latest
```

### Building the Docker Image

To build your own Docker image, do the following:

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ottomated/crewlink-server.git
cd crewlink-server
```

2. Run the Docker build command:
```sh
docker build -t ottomated/crewlink-server:build .
```

## Manual Installation

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* yarn
```sh
npm install yarn -g
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ottomated/crewlink-server.git
cd crewlink-server
```
2. Install NPM packages
```sh
yarn install
```
3. Compile and run the project
```JS
yarn start
```
4. Copy your server URL into CrewLink settings. Make sure everyone in your lobby is using the same server.

### Fixing Connection Issues

CrewLink-server should work out of the box for most people. You may, however, come across people who are unable to hear 
other people, no matter what they try. This could be because of a NAT or firewall that is preventing peer to peer
connections. In this case you may want to set up your own relay server to act as a middleman for your voice traffic.
CrewLink needs a specific type of server for this called a TURN server. As of yet CrewLink does not come with one by
default. 

You can configure a TURN server by creating a file called ``peer-config.yml`` in the config folder. Use the
provided example as a template. A good, open source TURN server implementation is [Coturn](https://github.com/coturn/coturn).

### Protecting Player IP Addresses
A relay server may also be desirable in case you want to prevent CrewLink players from detecting the IP addresses of
everyone in the same Among Us room using CrewLink. Check the section above on how to set one up.
